Problem Statement
In these projects, I tackled two key problems related to data structures and algorithms. The first project required analyzing the runtime and memory efficiency of various data structures, helping to determine the best choices for different applications. The second project involved implementing an algorithm to sort and display a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

Approach to the Problem
Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient code. I analyzed different structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash maps, comparing their time complexity and memory usage. In the sorting project, I selected an appropriate sorting algorithm to ensure efficiency while maintaining clarity in the output.

Overcoming Challenges
During development, I encountered challenges in choosing the most efficient data structures and debugging sorting logic. To resolve these, I used debugging tools, consulted documentation, and reviewed algorithmic principles to ensure optimal performance.

Software Design and Development Lessons
Working on these projects reinforced my understanding of algorithm efficiency and data organization. It emphasized the importance of selecting the right data structures for different tasks and considering trade-offs between speed and memory usage.

Code Readability and Maintainability
Through these projects, I refined my coding practices, focusing on writing modular, well-documented, and adaptable code. Proper structuring, clear function names, and meaningful comments ensure that future modifications and debugging will be more manageable.
